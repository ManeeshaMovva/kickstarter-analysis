                                          An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Louise’s goal is to have a successfully funded campaign for her play. Our job is to use to excel to analyze the dataset to make recommendations for her success.  
The chart I reviewed was the outcomes based on launch dates. By looking at the graph, we can see a high successful number of campaigns started in May and June. The least amount of successful campaigns launched in December. The recommendation I would make to Louise is to star her campaign in the months of May or June and to stay away from December. In addition, looking at the totals, May had the highest amount of campaigns and successful campaigns at that. May looks to be the best month to start your campaign, Louise.

# Crowdfunding In-Depth Analysis #
# Overview of Project 
Excel is a great tool for analyzing large datasets. Louise’s play Fever came extremely close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. However, she now wants to examine her competitors’ campaigns in terms of their launch dates and funding goals. We will be going through the data set to analyze how her play did compared to others with different launch dates and funding goals and possibly provide better recommendations for the future. 

# Analysis and Challenges
## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
After creating the pivot table and line graph, we are able to see that the most successful theater outcomes were launched in the months of May and June. If you look at the grand total, you can see that the most amount of campaigns altogether launched in a single month, whether successful, fail, or canceled, were launched in the months of May and June. 
## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Moving on, we can now look at the Outcomes Based on Goals chart to better assess that data. By looking at the data, you can tell that the campaigns with the funding goals over 50000 had the least amount of success. In almost every goal category, number of successful was higher than the number failed and canceled. As the funding goals increase, you can see less and less projects were launched as the goals became very high. Finally yet importantly, no campaign was canceled – they were either successful or a failure. 
## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The biggest challenge I encountered was creating the countif statements for “Outcomes Based on Goals.” I had trouble integrating the goal ranges into the statements as conditions. Once, I figured that out, it was smooth sailing. Another challenge I encountered was with the document being so large, my excel would consistently freeze and I was scared I would lose my work. 
# Results
##Conclusions about Theater Outcomes
One conclusion I can make about the theater outcomes data is May and June are the best months for launching a campaign. The next conclusion I can make is that December is the worst month. A possible reason for why December had such a low number of successful campaigns could have been because it is around the holidays. Everyone is spending their money to buy gifts and other things for family, friends, etc. so funding might be limited. 
##Conclusions about Outcomes Based on Goals
The biggest conclusion I can make about Outcomes Based on Goals is that all of the campaigns have either succeeded or failed – none of them were canceled. Something I found interesting, but not suprising, was the smaller numbers for campigns with funding goals greater than 50000 – the numbers being low was understandable as 50000+ in funding is a lot to expect compounded with other factors such as the audience you’re reaching, the economy, etc.
##Limitations and Recommendations of/for this Dataset
As we are only looking at certain parts of the data, we are not seeing the bigger picture. We are making the dataset even smaller which is nice to analyze certain pieces but to make informed recommendations and decisions; we would need to use the entire dataset. A recommendation I had was using average donations and backers count to see what an average backer was donating and to what type of plays to see which ones are the most popular and receiving the most funding. A bar graph could be useful in seeing the differences in numbers of successful, failed and canceled campaigns. Line Graphs are helpful to see the changes over times but a bar graph is more visually pleasing and a lot easier to read.
